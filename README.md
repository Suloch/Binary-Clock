# Binary-Clock
Representaion of time in binary format.
The program aks the user for current time and then displays the current time binary format.

## Purpose
I made this for my school project. I completely understand how dumb this code is.
In fact, I realized it back then, so I ended up not submitting this.

## Usage
I could not think of any but for whatever reason, if you may want to run this code,
you need that blue turbo C++ IDE in windows. And no, I didn't use Windows to write this code.
I used a turbo C++ IDE simulator for linux. If you ask why, I won't be able to reply because it is just too sad.
